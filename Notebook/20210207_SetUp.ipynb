    "I set up a github for this project. I will need to let the detector run for a long period of time, and have data update periodically for me and PHYS 150 students to look at. I plan on using git in the terminal of a raspberry pi to handle updates. \n",

    "I already have a detector and raspberry pi from Prof. Stuart that I will use to do coscmic ray detection. I am familiar with how this works and have already probed it to check its fucntionality. I will include this in my report, but I already have it done for previous work so I this notebook does not so much cover that. \n",

    "The detector basically works by sensing photons generated by scintillating material, and then generating an output signal for the rasperry pi to read. Two scintillating bars are inputted to and logic such that I will only get a signal if the bars are triggered at the same time. This is done because cosmic rays are very penetrating, whearas most background radiation is not penentrating enough to trigger stacked scinnitallors at the same time. This detector is light sensitive, so I will be keeping the whole thing covered in a box. It will stay in the corner of my room for the duration of collection. \n",
